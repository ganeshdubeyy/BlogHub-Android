## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **State Management**
Each screen manages its own dialog state:

```kotlin
// Delete dialog state
var showDeleteDialog by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
var postToDelete by remember { mutableStateOf<String?>(null) }

// Logout dialog state
var showLogoutDialog by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
```

### **Dialog Triggering**
Instead of immediate action, buttons now set state:

```kotlin
// Before (immediate delete):
onDeleteClick = { blogViewModel.deletePost(post.id) }

// After (show dialog first):
onDeleteClick = {
    postToDelete = post.id
    showDeleteDialog = true
}
```

### **Dialog Component**
Reusable component for consistency:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ConfirmationDialog(
    title: String,           // "Delete Blog" or "Logout"
    message: String,         // Confirmation message
    onConfirm: () -> Unit,   // Action to take on OK
    onDismiss: () -> Unit    // Action to take on Cancel
)
```

### **Material 3 AlertDialog**
Uses built-in Material 3 component:
- Automatic centering
- Backdrop overlay
- Dismissible behavior
- Proper button styling
